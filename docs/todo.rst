Known bugs and wanted features.

TEMPLATE: clear items and add items for your project.


****************************************************************************************
Required
****************************************************************************************

#. :Docs:

    Add an Open Collective badge.

#. :Upgrade:

    The ``devel-upgrade`` target doesn't add new Vale styles.

#. :Docs:

    Restore `general and module Sphinx indexes
    <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#special-names>`_
    in the branches for appropriate project types, for example ``(js|ts|etc.)``.


****************************************************************************************
High priority
****************************************************************************************

#. :Docker:

    Audit ``$ make -j devel-upgrade-branch`` to re-use existing images and otherwise
    reduce runtime as much as possible so that new CI jobs that build images are only
    run when upgrades actually change versions. See if that's enough to run it daily
    without exhausting GitLab's free monthly CI minutes.

#. :Docs:

   Docs benefit most from fresh eyes. If you find anything unclear, ask for help. When
   you understand better, contribute changes to the docs to help others.


****************************************************************************************
Nice to have
****************************************************************************************

#. :Release:

    `Homebrew formula and badge <https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/commitizen>`_

#. :Docs:

    Try out `other Sphinx themes
    <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/tutorial/more-sphinx-customization.html#using-a-third-party-html-theme>`_

#. :Lint:

    Try some of `the linters and formatters
    <https://unibeautify.com/docs/beautifier-stylelint>`_ supported by ``UniBeautify``:

    - ``Stylelint`` `CSS linter <https://stylelint.io/>`_
    - `js-beautify <https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-beautify>`_

#. :Docs:

    Try out the `rinohtype Sphinx renderer
    <https://www.mos6581.org/rinohtype/master/sphinx.html>`_.

#. :Release:

    Build operating system packages, such as ``*.deb``, ``*.rpm``, ``*.msi``, including
    documentation.

#. :Release:

    Add `a badge <https://repology.org/project/python:project-structure/badges>`_ for
    projects that publish packages to more than one repository.

#. :TODO:

    The list items in this document are the most important improvements that this
    project definitely needs. See also ``$ git grep -i -e todo`` comments throughout the
    source for other smaller, potential improvements.

#. :Lint:

    Resolve ignored linter failures::

      $ git grep -i -e \
      'alex disable hooks|hadolint ignore|pylint: disable|type: ignore' \
      -- '*.py'

#. :Docker:

    `Docker image build-time labels
    <https://specs.opencontainers.org/image-spec/annotations/?v=v1.0.1>`_::

      org.opencontainers.image.revision
      org.opencontainers.image.ref.name
      org.opencontainers.image.base.digest

#. :Docker:

    Container image variants, for example ``*:slim`` or ``*:alpine``:

    The might save less disk space than by using the most widely used base image, given
    that `different images share common image layers
    <https://hub.docker.com/_/buildpack-deps/>`_. This might also have security benefits
    but it also increases risk of incompatibility bugs, whether in the libraries or in
    distribution differences. As such, this probably isn't worth the effort until users
    report convincing use cases.

#. :Docker:

    CI/CD for other image platforms:

    This would cause one issue with CI resources. The pipelines already exhaust too much
    of the GitLab free CI/CD minutes for each run. Running the tests in ARM images would
    either consume even more free CI/CD minutes to run on cloud ARM runners. Or would
    take forever by using emulation in the dedicated project runners.

    Docker also lacks important support, creating another issue. Docker provides both
    the capability to build images for non-native platforms *and* run images for
    non-native platforms, both under QEMU emulation, albeit with a significant
    performance penalty. It seems support exists to build a non-native image, run the
    tests in it, and then publish it after passing. But Docker doesn't support local
    access to built multi-platform images, it only supports pushing them to a registry
    or exporting them to some form of filesystem archive. This means following runs of
    the image tag might use a different image than the one built locally. Someone else
    could have pushed another build to the registry between the push and following
    pull. Even worse, changing the ``platform: ...`` in ``./compose*.yml`` requires a
    ``$ docker compose pull ...`` to switch the image. This means pulling again and
    again some time after the push increasingly the likelihood of pulling an image other
    than the one built locally. This leaves a couple options. Parse the manifest digest
    from the build output and then use that to retrieve the digests for each platform's
    image and then use those digests in ``./compose*.yml``. Or output the multi-platform
    image to one of the local filesystem formats, figure how to import from there and do
    a similar dance to retrieve and use the digests. This would be fragile and would
    take a lot of work that is likely wasted effort when Docker or someone else provides
    a better way. IOW, these options would mean wastefully fighting tools and
    frameworks.

    As such, this probably isn't worth the effort until users report significant
    platform-specific bugs.
