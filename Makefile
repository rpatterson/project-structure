## Development, build and maintenance tasks:
#
# To ease discovery for new contributors, variables that act as options affecting
# behavior are at the top.  Then skip to `## Top-level targets:` below to find targets
# intended for use by developers.  The real work, however, is in the recipes for real
# targets that follow.  If making changes here, please start by reading the philosophy
# commentary at the bottom of this file.

# Project specific values:
export PROJECT_NAMESPACE=rpatterson
export PROJECT_NAME=project-structure

# Variables used as options to control behavior:
export TEMPLATE_IGNORE_EXISTING=false
# TEMPLATE: Create an NPM organization and set it's name here
NPM_SCOPE=rpattersonnet


## "Private" Variables:

# Variables that aren't likely to be of concern those just using and reading top-level
# targets.  Mostly variables whose values are derived from the environment or other
# values.  If adding a variable whose value isn't a literal constant or intended for use
# on the CLI as an option, add it to the appropriate grouping below.  Unfortunately,
# variables referenced in targets or prerequisites need to be defined above those
# references (as opposed to references in recipes), which means we can't move these
# further below for readability and discover.

## Makefile Development:
#
# Development primarily requires a balance of 2 priorities:
#
# - Ensure the correctness of the code and build artifacts
# - Minimize iteration time overhead in the inner loop of development
#
# This project uses Make to balance those priorities.  Target recipes capture the
# commands necessary to build artifacts, run tests, and check the code.  Top-level
# targets assemble those recipes to put it all together and ensure correctness.  Target
# prerequisites are used to define when build artifacts need to be updated so that
# time isn't wasted on unnecessary updates in the inner loop of development.
#
# The most important Make concept to understand if making changes here is that of real
# targets and prerequisites, as opposed to "phony" targets.  The target is only updated
# if any of its prerequisites are newer, IOW have a more recent modification time, than
# the target.  For example, if a new feature adds library as a new project dependency
# then correctness requires that the fixed/pinned versions be updated to include the new
# library.  Most of the time, however, the fixed/pinned versions don't need to be
# updated and it would waste significant time to always update them in the inner loop of
# development.  We express this relationship in Make by defining the files containing
# the fixed/pinned versions as targets and the `./setup.cfg` file where dependencies are
# defined as a prerequisite:
#
#    ./build/foo.txt: ./foo.txt.in
#    	envsubst <"$(<)" >"$(@)"
#
# To that end, developers should use real target files whenever possible when adding
# recipes to this file.
#
# Sometimes the task we need a recipe to accomplish should only be run when certain
# changes have been made and as such we can use those changed files as prerequisites but
# the task doesn't produce an artifact appropriate for use as the target for the recipe.
# In that case, the recipe can write "simulated" artifact such as by piping output to a
# log file:
#
#     ./var/log/foo.log:
#         mkdir -pv "$(dir $(@))"
#         echo "Do some work here" | tee -a "$(@)"
#
# This is also useful when none of the modification times of produced artifacts can be
# counted on to correctly reflect when any subsequent targets need to be updated when
# using this target as a pre-requisite in turn.  If no output can be captured, then the
# recipe can create arbitrary output:
#
#     ./var/log/foo.log:
#         echo "Do some work here"
#         mkdir -pv "$(dir $(@))"
#         date | tee -a "$(@)"
#
# If a target is needed by the recipe of another target but should *not* trigger updates
# when it's newer, such as one-time host install tasks, then use that target in a
# sub-make instead of as a prerequisite:
#
#     ./var/log/foo.log:
#         $(MAKE) "./var/log/bar.log"
#
# We use a few more Make features than these core features and welcome further use of
# such features:
#
# - `$(@)`:
#   The automatic variable containing the file path for the target
#
# - `$(<)`:
#   The automatic variable containing the file path for the first prerequisite
#
# - `$(FOO:%=foo-%)`:
#   Substitution references to generate transformations of space-separated values
#
# - `$ make FOO=bar ...`:
#   Overriding variables on the command-line when invoking make as "options"
#
# We want to avoid, however, using many more features of Make, particularly the more
# "magical" features, to keep it readable, discover-able, and otherwise accessible to
# developers who may not have significant familiarity with Make.  If there's a good,
# pragmatic reason to add use of further features feel free to make the case but avoid
# them if possible.
